# Notes

## Features

A summary of features implemented:

- dashboard stats
- view and create cinemas
- view and create screens
- view and filter screenings

## Assumptions

Regarding the API, as there was no further doumentation regarding fetching all the data or filtering by fields, i.e. name, id, etc, for the purposes of this task I have queried a large page size (99). Could make multiple requests to the same end point and check if itâ€™s the last set of data but opted to save time or in some cases use a autocomplete search.

## Further improvements

Improvements that could be looked into given more time:

- Unit test coverage
- Error handling on api requests and state, e.g. home/dashboard forkJoin
- Loading state, e.g. per stat card on home/dashboard
- Create base api and pagination services for common logic (abstract)
- Reusable components; heading, table, container, app-layout
- Use of state management tool
- Linting via eslint and stylelint
- Could move component data/stores into their own services for better separation of concerns
  - i.e. component for UI logic, store service for state management and network calls
